# LeetCode Solutions

Just my personal collection of LeetCode solutions. Nothing fancy, just keeping track of problems I've worked through.

This repo is primarily Python-based solutions. My original C++ solutions are in a different repository called competitive-programming.

## What's in here

Each folder is basically a different problem I've tackled. The naming follows the LeetCode format with problem numbers and titles so I can find stuff easily later.

I've been working on all sorts of problems - arrays, strings, trees, dynamic programming, you name it. Some took forever to figure out, others clicked right away. It's all part of the process.

## About the solutions

I try to write clean code that actually works, but I'm always learning better approaches. The LeetSync integration shows timing and memory usage which is pretty helpful for seeing how things perform.

This is mainly for my own reference and practice. If you stumble across this repo somehow, feel free to take a look, but keep in mind these are just my solutions and there are usually multiple ways to solve these problems.
